      <p>
        I grew up allergic to the baked goods everyone else could eat â€” dairy, nuts, and sesame were always off the table.
        Thatâ€™s why I started Zacharyâ€™s Snackery: a brand that brings bold, nostalgic flavors to everyone in an allergy-friendly way.
        Every baked good is made without dairy, nuts, or sesame â€” so no one has to miss out on the good stuff.
