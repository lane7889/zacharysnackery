      <h1>Zachary’s Snackery</h1>
      <p>I grew up allergic to the baked goods everyone else could eat — dairy, nuts, and sesame were always off the table. That’s why I started Zachary’s Snackery: a brand that brings bold, nostalgic flavors to everyone in an allergy-friendly way. Every baked good is made without dairy, nuts, or sesame — so no one has to miss out on the good stuff.</p>

      <h2>Baked Goods</h2>
      <h3>Gingersnaps</h3>
      <p>Classic spice with a crisp snap and warm molasses finish — perfect with a cup of tea or just on their own.</p>
      <h3>Chocolate Crinkle Cookies</h3>
      <p>Rich, fudgy chocolate cookies rolled in powdered sugar — cracked on the outside, soft on the inside.</p>
      <h3>Snickerdoodles</h3>
      <p>Soft, cinnamon-sweet, and kissed with gentle salt — a timeless favorite with an allergy-friendly twist. Also really good with coffee.</p>
